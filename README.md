# Common Git Errors and Solutions

I see new users to git with the same solution.


### Problem: You made a git repository inside a git repository on your computer
### Short-term fix: 
### Long-term solution: 
When you want to initialize or clone down a git repository, make sure you aren't in a git repository by running `git status`.

### Problem: You are stuck in VIM because you didn't include a full commit message or have a merge conflict.
### Short-term fix: Press `esc` (the escape key). Then type `:` (colon). Then type `q`. ðŸŽ‰

### Long-term solution: 
Always add a commit message and avoid merge conflicts. You can set up a default text editor for git. If you have [VSCode]() (and it's free and I recommend it), see [this link]() to learn how you can set it up as your default for git.

### Problem: I want to reset my local git repository to match a repository in the cloud (for example, on GitHub). Warning, this will wipe out any local changes.

### Short-term fix: `git reset hard --head`

### Long-term solution:

### Problem: I have a merge conflict so I can't pull down an updated repository.
### Short-term fix: `git reset hard --head`
### Long-term solution:
